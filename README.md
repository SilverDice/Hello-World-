# Hello-World-
Personal Intro to Git

Greetings,

I am a High School Student who has taken classes of Python and Java but due to the passage of time, I have forgotten
most of the info and commands.

This is my first real interaction with GitHub and I am trying to get back into coding before heading to college.
